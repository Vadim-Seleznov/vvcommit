# COMMANDS

THIS FILE DESCRIBES AVAIBLE COMMANDS IN VVCOMMIT

## HELP

```bash
vvcommit help
```

for getting basic help in terminal

## INITIALIZATION

1. With this tool you can init your github repo with one line. Just go into github page and click at "new repo". Then give it a name, description and visibility flag.
Now you can just do:

```bash
vvcommit init github-login repo-name
```

in your terminal
for example I want to create a repo "shop"
so I do for example NEXT JS project and now time to create a repo for it.

```bash
vvcommit init Vadim-Seleznov shop
```

2. Of course you can also push stuff into existing repo:

```bash
vvcommit push-ex Vadim-Seleznov shop
```

## COMMIT

1. Commit without pushing:

```bash
vvcommit com "commit message"
```

or without alias, BUT BETTER HAVE AN ALLIAS!

```bash
python ./vvcommit.py com "commit message"
```

(if you don't have an alias just write "python" every time at the start of every command)


2. Commit and push into current branch:

```bash
vvcommit curr "commit message"
```

3. Commit and push to a specific branch:

cbranch == commit branch, not copy branch!

```bash
vvcommit cbranch branch-name "commit message"
```

## PULL

1. Pull current branch (kinda useless but):

```bash
vvcommit pull
```

2. Pull a specific branch:
```bash
vvcommit pull branch-name
```

## BRANCH CREATION

1. Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
vvcommit branch-create <type> <name>
```

Example:
```bash
vvcommit branch-create f login
```

that will create branch feature/login

| Key | Prefix |
|-----|--------|
| f | feature/ |
| b | bugfix/ |
| h | hotfix/ |
| e | no prefix |
| c | custom prefix |

2. Branch Merge
When ending a branch, only the suffix is required:

```bash
vvcommit branch-end footer-bug
```

We got also 2 flags here delete, and remote if we wanna delete this branch after merging and if we want to also delete from remote
Example:

```bash
vvcommit branch-end delete remote footer-bug
```

OR

```bash
vvcommit branch-end delete footer-bug
```

## UPDATE

Also we an always get latest version of tool from github using command:

```bash
vvcommit update
```

or if we don't want to save backup file (for safety)

```bash
vvcommit update --no-backup
```

## IGNORE

THIS FEATURE IS USELESS IF YOU HAVE alias

But if you use program like this:
you just copy vvcommit.py file into your repo and then working with tool with:
```bash
python ./vvcommit.py ....
```

this feature can help you to add vvcommit to .ignore to not "sharing" it or something.
I just didn't want to delete this feature just because I've spent some time on it:)

1. Ignoring itself

```bash
vvcommit ignore
```

this command will add vvcommit.py and vvcommit.py.bak (if exists) into .gitignore and removes them from github repo

2. Restore

this command will restore previous ignore request

```bash
vvcommit ignore --restore
```
